Info: Running Quartus Prime Timing Analyzer
    Info: Version 18.1.0 Build 625 09/12/2018 SJ Lite Edition
    Info: Processing started: Mon May 06 19:24:28 2019
Info: Command: quartus_sta digital_project -c digital_project
Info: qsta_default_script.tcl version: #1
Warning (18236): Number of processors has not been specified which may cause overloading on shared machines.  Set the global assignment NUM_PARALLEL_PROCESSORS in your QSF to an appropriate value for best performance.
Info (20030): Parallel compilation is enabled and will use 2 of the 2 processors detected
Info (21077): Low junction temperature is 0 degrees C
Info (21077): High junction temperature is 85 degrees C
Info (334003): Started post-fitting delay annotation
Info (334004): Delay annotation completed successfully
Warning (332046): Timing netlist is empty. No timing reports will be generated.
Critical Warning (332012): Synopsys Design Constraints File file not found: 'digital_project.sdc'. A Synopsys Design Constraints File is required by the Timing Analyzer to get proper timing constraints. Without it, the Compiler will not properly optimize the design.
Info: Found TIMING_ANALYZER_REPORT_SCRIPT_INCLUDE_DEFAULT_ANALYSIS = ON
Info: Can't run Report Timing Closure Recommendations. The current device family is not supported.
Info: Quartus Prime Timing Analyzer was successful. 0 errors, 3 warnings
    Info: Peak virtual memory: 4665 megabytes
    Info: Processing ended: Mon May 06 19:24:30 2019
    Info: Elapsed time: 00:00:02
    Info: Total CPU time (on all processors): 00:00:02
